# NSuite

NSuite is a framework for the implementation and execution of benchmarks and numerical validations for multi-compartment neural network simulators. The framework currently supports Arbor, NEURON, and CoreNeuron, while allowing other simulation engines to be added.

NSuite is specifically designed to allow easy deployment on HPC systems in testing workflows, such as benchmark-driven development or continuous integration.

To get started using NSuite please refer to the online documentation at [Read the Docs](http://nsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
